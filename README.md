# Git Intermediate Activity

This repository will accept pull requests during the hands-on activity during the Git Intermediate class.

Visit the course materials for the hands-on activity at [http://www.github.com/uwescience/git-intermediate]. This repository also accepts pull requests if you find typos or want to improve exercises!

First, add a file named after your initials to the appropriate class folder.

In the later activity, you will edit the `git-review.md` file to answer a review question. Instructions in course materials, but may change in class! You'll receive numbers in class to determine which questions you'll answer.
